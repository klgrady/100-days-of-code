# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on backend of Wordpress plugin.

**Thoughts:** Gods, I'm old. I could have finished this project ten hours ago if this were ten years ago. I'm soooooper rusty, yo. Also, Wordpress makes some things crazy easy. And then there's uploading a file. I will eventually solve this puzzle.

### Day 2: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed backend functionality, including image uploader. Load tested functionality with ~5000 craft beer entries. Backend works!

**Thoughts**: I don't know how I pulled that off, but I did. Wheeee.

### Day 3: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Some testing. 

**Thoughts**: I meant to spend time on Udacity today, but life. Also, I can no longer work asst home if the Y's are around. They're noisy and require interaction. 

**Link(s) to work**: Same as before. 


### Day 4: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Oops! Have forgotten to log progress. Lots of cleanup and streamlining backend, improving UI, expanding usability. Also started milspotsy.com. Just a holder page in place for now.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm trudging along, but I know what I'm doing is good stuff. I also know I really need to insert some nonces in this business.
