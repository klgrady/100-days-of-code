# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on backend of Wordpress plugin.

**Thoughts:** Gods, I'm old. I could have finished this project ten hours ago if this were ten years ago. I'm soooooper rusty, yo. Also, Wordpress makes some things crazy easy. And then there's uploading a file. I will eventually solve this puzzle.
